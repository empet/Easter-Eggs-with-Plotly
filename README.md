# Easter-Eggs-with-Plotly

The first Jupyter Notebook  illustrates how to paint an Easter egg with different Julia sets. (Python code; plotly.py)
The second one defines an Easter egg as a  textured surface and displays its rotation about zaxis. (Julia code: PlotlyJS.jl, and animation with Plots.jl).
