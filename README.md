# Easter-Eggs-with-Plotly

The first Jupyter Notebook [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Easter-Eggs-with-Plotly/blob/master/Plotting-an-Easter-Egg.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Easter-Eggs-with-Plotly/blob/master/Plotting-an-Easter-Egg.ipynb)
illustrates how to paint an Easter egg with different Julia sets. (Python code; plotly.py)
The second notebook [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Easter-Eggs-with-Plotly/blob/master/Julia-Easter-egg-with-texture-animated.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Easter-Eggs-with-Plotly/blob/master/Julia-Easter-egg-with-texture-animated.ipynb) defines an Easter egg with texture.
The egg is animated (rotated) to display completely the textured surface.
(Julia code: PlotlyJS.jl).

We switched from Python to Julia, because the Julia package, `Plots.jl`, provides an excelent tool to create smooth animations.
